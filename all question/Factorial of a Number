Algorithm to Calculate the Factorial of a Number in C (Without Using Functions):
1. Start.
2. Input: Read the value of n from the user (where n is a non-negative integer).
3. Initialize a variable fact = 1 to store the factorial result.
4. Check if n is 0 or 1:
5. If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1 (since 0! = 1! = 1).
6. Loop from i = 1 to n:
7. Multiply fact by i in each iteration.
8. Output the value of fact (which is the factorial of n).
9. End.



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    int n;
    int fact=1;
    printf("enter value of n : ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        fact = fact*i;
    }
    printf("factorial of %d = %d" , n ,fact);
    
    return 0;
}
