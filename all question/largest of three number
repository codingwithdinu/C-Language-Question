Algorithm to Find the Largest of Three Numbers in C (Without Using Functions):
1. Start.
2. Input: Read three numbers, say a, b, and c, from the user.
3. Compare the Numbers:
   If a is greater than or equal to both b and c, then a is the largest.
   Else if b is greater than or equal to both a and c, then b is the largest.
   Else, c is the largest.
4. Output: Print the largest number.
5. End.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c;

    // Input three numbers
    printf("Enter the value of a: ");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Enter the value of b: ");
    scanf("%d", &b);
    printf("Enter the value of c: ");
    scanf("%d", &c);

    // Compare the numbers to find the largest
    if (a >= b && a >= c) {
        printf("The largest number is: %d\n", a);
    } else if (b >= a && b >= c) {
        printf("The largest number is: %d\n", b);
    } else {
        printf("The largest number is: %d\n", c);
    }

    return 0;
}
