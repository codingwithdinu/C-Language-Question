Algorithm to Convert a Year into Minutes, Hours, Days, Months, and Seconds Using Switch Case (Without Using Functions):
1. Start.
2. Input: Read the year y from the user.
3. Input: Read the choice of conversion from the user (which unit they want the conversion in: minutes, hours, days, months, or seconds).
             Switch Case:
             Case 1 (for Minutes):
                                  Calculate the number of minutes in a year: minutes = y * 365 * 24 * 60 (assuming non-leap year for simplification).
                                  If it is a leap year, add extra days (366 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes).
            Case 2 (for Hours):
                                Calculate the number of hours in a year: hours = y * 365 * 24 (for a non-leap year).
                                If it is a leap year, add 366 * 24 hours.
            Case 3 (for Days):
                                Calculate the number of days in a year:
                                If it's a leap year: days = 366.
                                  Otherwise, days = 365.
           Case 4 (for Months):
                                Assume 12 months in a year, so print months = 12.
           Case 5 (for Seconds):
                                 Calculate the number of seconds in a year: seconds = y * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 (for a non-leap year).
                                  If it's a leap year, add 366 * 24 * 60 * 60 seconds.
4. Output: Print the converted value based on the user's choice.
5. End.
