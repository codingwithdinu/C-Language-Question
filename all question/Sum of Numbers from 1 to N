Algorithm to Calculate the Sum of Numbers from 1 to N in C (Without Using Functions):
1. Start.
2. Input: Read the value of n (the upper limit) from the user.
3. Initialize a variable sum = 0 to hold the total sum.
4. Loop through the numbers from 1 to n:
   For each number i, add it to sum (i.e., sum = sum + i).
5. Output: Print the value of sum.
6. End.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, sum = 0;

    // Input the value of n
    printf("Enter a number (n): ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Loop through numbers from 1 to n and calculate sum
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i;  // Add i to sum
    }

    // Output the result
    printf("The sum of numbers from 1 to %d is: %d\n", n, sum);

    return 0;
}
