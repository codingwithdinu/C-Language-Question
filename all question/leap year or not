Algorithm to Check Leap Year in C:
1. Start.
2. Input: Read the year y from the user.
3. Check Leap Year Conditions:
   If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
   OR if the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
4. Output:
   If the year satisfies the conditions of a leap year, print "Leap Year".
   Otherwise, print "Not a Leap Year".
5. End.


#include <stdio.h>

//leap year or not  

int main(){

    int year;

    printf("enter a year : ");
    scanf("%d" , &year);

    if(year%4==0 && year%400==0 && year%100==0)
    {
        printf("%d is a leap year" , year);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d is not leap year" , year);
    }
    return 0;
}
